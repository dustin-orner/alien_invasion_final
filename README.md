# alien_invasion_final
This is the final draft of the Alien Invasion game that I worked on. This is a project outlined in Python Crash Course, Second Edition by Eric Matthes. 

Players press left and right arrow keys to move back and forth, and the "SPACE" bar to fire. Press "Q" to quit, or click the exit button at the top right of the window. Have fun!
